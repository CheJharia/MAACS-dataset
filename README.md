maacs file for second week lectures
========================================================

This repository just contains this file, and the maacs
dataset needed in the second week lectures;)

***
To load the maacs dataset, just save it in your working directory
or fork this project, and "load" it using:
```{r}
load("maacs.rda")
```
***


This is not very much in the spirit of the class
because I am not really documenting every step in
producing maacs.rda. However, I made it by combining
columns from:

maacs_env.rds, found at
https://github.com/jtleek/modules/blob/master/04_ExploratoryAnalysis/PlottingLattice/maacs_env.rds

and

problem3.rda, found at
https://github.com/jtleek/jhsph753and4/blob/master/lectures/EBDA/problem3.rda
